The Simple JavaScript Calculator
1. This is a simple and interactive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. It features a clean and modern design with smooth button interactions.
4. The project was created as part of my learning journey to improve my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS grid layouts.

Features:
1. Perform basic arithmetic operations: +, −, ×, ÷
2. Clear display functionality
3. Decimal point input
4. Real-time display updates
5. Responsive layout with centered design
6. Interactive hover and active button effects

Tech Stack Used:
1. HTML – For structure
2. CSS – For styling and layout (Grid & Flexbox)
3. JavaScript – For functionality and user interaction

Project Structure:
1. index.html → Contains the markup for the calculator interface
2. calculator.css → Handles the design and layout of the calculator
3. calculator.js → Adds the calculator’s core functionality

How It Works:
1. Users can click the number and operator buttons to form expressions.
2. The = button evaluates the expression using JavaScript’s eval() function.
3. The C button clears the display.
4. Errors in calculation are handled gracefully by displaying “Error”.

How to Run the Project:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Start performing calculations.

Future Improvements:
1. Add support for keyboard input
2. Include scientific functions (e.g., square roots, percentages)
3. Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes
